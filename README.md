# OS
my journey to a better operating system (__our os__)

> __our os__ stands on the shoulders of the giants

Our OS = Linux Distribution (like Ubuntu) + DE (Gnome, Cosmic or Pantheon) + Software Tools

## Vison

smart OS that is ours

- smart package manager: abstraction over __apt__, __flatpak__, __snap__ and __appimage__.
- app store : abstraction with ability to pay-as-you-want option + all supported packaging. (or easy to adopt alt packaging)
- IDE : UI designer + Code editor + autocomplete + __Go__/__Rust__/C/CPP.

## Main features and aspects

- seamless editing
- seamless settings
- terminal friendly with keyboard/mouse/touchpad/touch screen
