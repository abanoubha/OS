# OS
my journey to a better operating system (__our os__)

> __our os__ stands on the shoulders of the giants
> â€” Abanoub Hanna

Our OS = Linux Distribution (like Ubuntu) + DE (Gnome, Cosmic or Pantheon) + Software Tools

## Vison

smart OS that is ours

- smart package manager: abstraction over __apt__, __flatpak__, __snap__ and __appimage__.
- app store : abstraction with ability to pay-as-you-want option + all supported packaging. (or easy to adopt alt packaging)
- IDE : UI designer + Code editor + autocomplete + __Go__/__Rust__/C/CPP.

## Main features and aspects

- seamless editing
- seamless settings
- terminal friendly with keyboard/mouse/touchpad/touch screen
- GUI friendly w/ keyboard/mouse/touchpad/touch screen
- features that makes sense and help get the job done
- at the speed of thought
- settings GUI, config file, seamless settings
- self-repair
- self-configure

## thoughts

- seamless editing : edit the thing at the thing itself
- seamless settings
- terminal ready : you can do everything in terminal
- ui/ux ready : you can do everything in GUI
- ~tiling window manager~ (in a modern way)
- all key shortcuts
- configurable via __conf files__ or __settings app gui__
- blazing fast with less RAM usage (use RUST)
- dynamic linked apps (work smart)
- ~pm : package manager made for this OS~
- can install .deb , flatpak, snap, .appimage , .. and all linux packages. Add apk (android via anbox), and exe (windows via WINE), and app/pkg (apple - maybe)
- ~HiDPI and loDPI screens / displays~ (Ubuntu-based)
- ~pick stability from Debian and Ubuntu + drivers for VMs and HW.~ (Ubuntu-based)
- touch friendly : big roundy icons and buttons
- developer documentation, video tutorials : for devs
- usage documentation, video tutorials : for users
- pay-as-you-can app store
- ready to use libraries for all various things (text to speech, speech to text, OCR, decoders, encoders, .. )
- support for all display languages and keyboard layouts
- support for Go, Rust, C++, C, Java, Kotlin, Swift (SwiftUI), dart (flutter) .. etc (choose a standard one)
- ~file system (fs) with versioning (like btrfs) with speed~
- reactive programming : not-async=bg and not-sync=blocking.
- touchpad gestures : like gnome 40 or mac os
- usage documentation, video tutorials : for 
- file extension hints at the program used to open the file
- send to desktop (shortcut)
- support flatpak & snap & apt with the first app installed of a package manager
- if you use pacman for example, the error will tell you to use apt or snap or flatpak to install the app
